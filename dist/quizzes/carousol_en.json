    "title": "Lineman Operational Guide: Technical Data & Safety Standards",
    "instruction": "For a professional lineman, it is extremely important to know not only safety but also correct technical measurements or data. Below are 30 important rules and data:",
    "rules": [
        "In 11kV lines, phase-to-phase voltage is 11,000V and phase-to-earth is 6,350V.",
        "When running LT lines over roads, maintain a minimum height or ground clearance of 5.8 meters (19 feet).",
        "A minimum clearance of 5.5 meters is mandatory for LT lines along the roadside.",
        "Maintain a vertical distance of at least 3.7 meters from house roofs for 11kV lines.",
        "The horizontal distance of LT lines from buildings should not be less than 1.2 meters.",
        "For LT lines, keep the distance between two poles or span generally within 40-45 meters in residential areas.",
        "The span for 11kV lines should generally not exceed 60-70 meters (depending on conductor type).",
        "Ideal earthing resistance is below 1 ohm for substations and 5 ohms for ordinary poles.",
        "Ensure a depth of at least 2.5 to 3 meters when installing earth pipes or rods.",
        "Ensure system neutral earthing (Guard Earthing) at every fourth or fifth pole.",
        "Match the feeder number and time in the 'Permit to Work' (PTW) document before climbing a pole.",
        "Before working on 11kV lines, always short and earth the phases using a discharge rod.",
        "Perform an 'air leakage' test before using insulated gloves; even a tiny hole is fatal.",
        "Working on electrical lines while wearing rings, watches, or metal chains is strictly prohibited.",
        "Always use fuses of the correct rating for LT line service connections; do not connect wires directly.",
        "Maintain HT and LT side clearances according to standards when installing transformers.",
        "Always lock the safety belt in the correct position after reaching the top of the pole, not while climbing.",
        "Do not use aluminum or metal body ladders for electrical line work.",
        "Refrain from climbing poles or working during rain or when there is high humidity on the lines.",
        "Use correct insulated screwdrivers and pliers when working on Junction Boxes (JB) or pillars.",
        "Clearance decreases if wire sag is too much on overhead lines, so tie them tightly.",
        "Be alert about 'Anytime Back-feed', especially in solar or generator connections.",
        "Create a safety perimeter using traffic cones and red flags during roadside work.",
        "Ensure at least 1/6th of the total length of the pole is underground when installing it.",
        "When using stay wires, ensure the insulator is at least 3 meters above ground level.",
        "Reverse current can come from a house inverter, so check with a tester even if the 'line is off'.",
        "Wearing a helmet is mandatory when working in high-voltage areas; it protects the head from wire contact.",
        "If a colleague is electrocuted, separate them using an insulated rod instead of touching them directly.",
        "Clean used tools after every shift and check for cracks in the insulation.",
        "Remember, following correct technical data and protocols is the mark of a skilled and safe lineman."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Correct measurement and caution—these two are the foundation of a lineman's work. Stay safe, work according to the rules."
